# CS 370 Reflection
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I worked on developing a reinforcement learning agent that could navigate a maze and find a path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. I was given several important pieces of starter code, including the environment setup in TreasureMaze.py, which defines the maze layout and reward system, and GameExperience.py, which handles experience replay so the agent can learn from previous actions. I was also given part of the Jupyter notebook with a predefined neural network structure and visualization tools. The main code I created myself was the Q-training algorithm. I implemented the logic to train the agent using exploration and exploitation strategies, store and sample from memory, fit the neural network, and update rewards. I also ensured the trained agent could successfully find the treasure and visualized its final path.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing and building systems that perform useful tasks. They create algorithms, software, and applications that improve how we live and workâ€”everything from organizing massive amounts of data to making predictions, securing systems, or automating tasks. This work matters because technology touches nearly every part of modern life. By building smart, ethical, and efficient systems, computer scientists help drive innovation, reduce human error, and create new opportunities across industries.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by first breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. I identify the inputs, desired outputs, and any constraints or goals. Then I look for patterns or existing solutions I can adapt. I test ideas, iterate on them, and evaluate their effectiveness based on performance, accuracy, or user needs. This approach helps me move from a vague challenge to a structured, solvable task using logical reasoning, data structures, and algorithms.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I have a responsibility to build systems that are safe, fair, and respectful of users' privacy and autonomy. That means avoiding harmful bias in algorithms, ensuring accessibility, and protecting data. For the organization, I must ensure the software I develop is reliable, secure, and aligned with legal and ethical standards. My work can impact individuals and communities, so ethical decision-making should guide not just the code I write, but also how it's used and maintained over time.
